# Introduction

We often need to convert cases like camelCase to kebab-case , PascalCase to snake_case and so on. because in some frontend or backend technologies have some restrictions in case naming. In this case , we can directly rename them. But the best idea would be set a package which would change the cases and this package does this !

# Demo
